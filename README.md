## Telecommunications Systems Project

### Academic Year: 2022/2023

### Course

- Telecommunications and Informatics Engineering
- 3rd Year, 2nd Semester

## Project Overview

This project aims to design and optimize a bidirectional digital microwave link between Sines and Odemira for an STM-1 signal (155 Mbit/s) supporting 64 channels of video between two terrestrial digital television (TDT) stations. The project adheres to ITU-R standards, ensuring reliable and efficient communication.

### Project Phases

#### Phase 1 (Completed)

1. **Study of Working Frequencies**: Identified the most suitable frequencies and calculated noise factors and transmission power.
2. **Direct Link Feasibility**: Assessed the feasibility of a direct microwave link between Sines and Odemira.
3. **Alternative Routes via Repeaters**: Explored alternative routing options using repeaters to ensure signal integrity.

#### Phase 2 (Current Phase)

This phase builds upon the initial findings and focuses on the following:

1. **Application of ITU-R Standards**: Demonstrate compliance with ITU-R standards, optimizing for the best frequency and final critical margin (~3 dB). Specific values are determined using the Feixer tool for various scenarios.
2. **Type of Diversity and Equalization**: Identify the types of diversity and equalization methods employed if necessary.
3. **Reliability Study**: Evaluate the reliability of the final link, minimizing project costs.
4. **Calculation of Mirror Angles**: Based on project coordinates and geometry, calculate the final angles for mirrors or other repeaters. Include only final values in the main report; detailed calculations are presented in the appendix.
5. **Equipment and Cost Listing**: Provide a table listing all required equipment, their costs, and specifications (mast height and type, shelters, antenna and mirror location, diameter, orientation, transmitter power, receiver noise factor, guide types, lengths, and attenuation, etc.).
6. **Cost Evolution**: Present a table and graph showing annual cost evolution over the project lifecycle, indicating the average daily cost.
7. **Appendix**: Attach Feixer tool versions for both the direct and optimized final routes.

### Final Report Structure

- The main body of the report is limited to 20 pages, containing all required results.
